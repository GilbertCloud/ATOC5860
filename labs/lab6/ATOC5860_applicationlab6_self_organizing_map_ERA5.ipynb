    "### LEARNING GOALS:\n",
    "1. Apply self organizing maps as an example of unsupervised (grouping events into different categories) machine learning. Build understanding of the technique for Bay of Bengal circulation (sea level pressure anomaly) and precipitation.\n",
    "2. Assess the influence of user specified parameters on the SOM results.  Use Sammon maps and other statistical tests to assess the fit of the SOM the training data.  Compare a 3x3 node SOM vs. a 4x4 node SOM. You should find that the Sammon map looks better for the 3x3 SOM than for the 4x4 SOM.  The 4x4 sammon map has twisting indicating you may not need so many patterns to describe the data.  Too much twisting = too many nodes.\n",
    "3. Map a composite variable (in this case precipitation) to the self organizing map nodes (in this case based on sea level pressure anomaly).  Understand the added value of associating additional variables to a SOM.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### DATA and UNDERLYING SCIENCE MOTIVATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use self-organizing maps (S0M) to assess patterns of sea level pressure variability and precipitation in the Bay of Bengal. We will be working daily (at 12 UTC) ERA5 reanalysis data from 2020 to 2022.  The dataset is small so that you can tinker without waiting too long.... This entire notebook should run on a personal computer in < 10 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we train the SOM using the daily spatial maps of sea level pressure (SLP) anomaly (the anomaly at each grid point with respect to the domain averaged of SLP). The SOM is trained with SLP anomaly rather than SLP magnitude because SLP gradients, rather than absolute values of SLP, are responsible for dictating near-surface circulation. The result of the SOM training are SOM patterns which depict the range in SLP anomaly patterns present in the training data. The number of SOM patterns is user-specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, each data point in the training data set will be \"mapped\" to the SOM pattern to which it is most similar, i.e., its best matching unit (BMU).  Similarity is established quantitatively using the least squared difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we determine and visualize the relative frequencies of each SOM pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we analyze and visualize how a 'composite variable' maps to the individual SOM pattern. In this case, total precipitation is the composite variable that we map to the sea level pressure SOM. In a SOM analysis, additional value often comes from linking composite variables to the SOM patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question to guide your analysis** \n",
    "\n",
    "When training a SOM, there are various parameters which are specified by the user.  It is advised to test out multiple combinations of parameters to find the combination which \"best\" trains the SOM. In order to determine if one SOM is better-trained than another, you will create sammon maps, and calculate various statistical values which reveal how well the SOM fits the training data. \n"

Since the SLP data is originally provided as a 3D variable, where z = time, y = latitude, x = longitude, masked by the SLP value at that lat/lon/time, we must flatten the SLP data from each case. This means we take the 2D SLP data from a given case and arrange it in a 1D array with length len(latitude) x len(longitude).

Thus, after running the below cell, you will have two SOM output files that you can run through the future cells to compare the outputs. If you have time, you can try some other options to compare the output. Recommended options to try: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",

The period can be any number, but generally, the higher the number, the better trained the SOM will be (too a point, past which the SOM output may be subject to over-fitting). The code is set up below to train with a period of 10000. If you have time, you can try some other options to compare the output. Recommended options to try: 1000, 5000, 50000, 100000 (a choice of 1000 or 5000 will lead to a relatively poorly-trained SOM, but it will take less time to run, so can be used as a check to make sure things are working properly)\n",
    "- **learning rate** (indicated by variable 'k'): This will set the learning rate, which dictates how much a training data case is allowed to change the SOM patterns which introduced to the SOM during training. Learning rate must be a value between 0 and 1, where a higher number means the SOM patterns will be more heavily impacted by each training data case. If you use too low of a learning rate, the SOM patterns may not match the data very well, but if you use too high of a learning rate, the SOM output may be subject to over-fitting. The code is set up below to train with a learning rate of 0.3. If you have time, you can try some other options to compare the output. Recommended options to try: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5\n",

    "## Step 7: Determine how well the SOM fits the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to looking at a sammon map, various statistical values can be calculated to reveal how well the SOM patterns represents the actual data. Some common metrics include root mean squared difference (RMSD), bias, and correlation coefficient. For a SOM analysis, each of these statistical values is calculated for each individual case, by comparing the case and the SOM pattern to which the case is mapped, and then taking an average across all cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful metric is often the RMSD, as it is not impacted by the sign of the difference, and is thus better retained when taking an average across all cases. Also, RMSD is given in the same units as those of the training data and SOM patterns, so its meaning is easily understood. Bias is usually less useful because when taking an average across all cases, instances of the same magnitude of bias but with opposite signs will cancel each other out.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical values will almost always have values that show a better match to the data (lower RMSD and bias, and higher correlation coefficient) when the map size is increased. This doesn't necessarily mean that the bigger map size is the better choice. It all depends on what the goal of your study is. These statistics are better used not to choose between map sizes, but rather to choose which training period and training length within a set map size produces better results."
